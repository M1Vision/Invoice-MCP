# Invoice MCP
A Model Context Protocol server for creating professional PDF invoices using natural language.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

### 1. Installation

git clone https://github.com/markslorach/invoice-mcp.git
cd invoice-mcp/server
npm install
npm run build
```

### 2. Configuring Claude Desktop
Add the following json to your Claude Desktop config file -

**macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

This be accessed in Claude Desktop settings in the Developer tab.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "Invoice MCP Server": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": [
        "/path/to/your/invoice-mcp/server/build/index.js"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

**Example path -** 
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "Invoice MCP Server": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": [
        "/Users/markslorach/Desktop/invoice-mcp/server/build/index.js"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

> Make sure to restart Claude Desktop for the MCP server to show in chat tools.

## Usage

### Prompt Examples

You can be brief -
```text
Create an invoice to Mike Smith for web development work
```

Or detailed - 
```text
Create an invoice to Mike Smith for:
- Logo design (5 hours @ £75/hour)
- Website updates (3 hours @ £60/hour)
- Due in 14 days

123 Business Street, London, SW1A 1AA
mike@business.com
```

By using the instructions below, you'll be prompted to confirm or add any missing details. You can then confirm and create the invoice without all customer details if needed.

## Demo

### Logo Requirements
A logo is optional - if provided, it must be a **direct URL** to a JPG, PNG, or WebP image file. The URL must end with the file extension (e.g., .jpg, .png) and link directly to the image, not a webpage. **SVG files are not supported.**

I recommend using an image with no padding around the logo for best results.

✅ Good: https://example.com/logo.png <br>
❌ Bad: https://example.com/logo-page or https://example.com/logo.svg

### Prompt Instructions
For consistent invoice generation, I recommend filling in and adding these instructions to a Claude Desktop project. If using another platform without project support - you can paste these instructions at the start of your conversation before creating an invoice.

### Default Notes:
"Thank you for your business."

## Processing Rules

### Confirmation Required
**ALWAYS** ask the user to confirm all invoice details before running the MCP tool and exporting the PDF - even for mock/test invoices. Present the confirmation in a clear, readable format.

### Invoice Detection
Watch for invoice-related keywords: "invoice", "bill", "charge", "billing" - users may say "invoice Joe Bloggs for..." instead of "create an invoice for..."

### Service Descriptions
- Enter services exactly as mentioned by the user
- Do NOT modify or rephrase service descriptions apart from correcting obvious spelling mistakes
- Preserve the user's original wording and terminology
- Never include the price in the title or description
- For hourly work, include the hourly rate in the description (e.g., "Web development @ £50.00/hour") so the quantity field represents hours worked

### Invoice Numbering
Create unique invoice numbers using format: `[Customer Initials]-[DD-MM-YYYY]`  
Examples: 
- "John Smith" on 15th January 2024 = `JS-15-01-2024`
- "ABC Limited" on 3rd March 2024 = `AL-03-03-2024`

### Date Handling
- Default invoice date to today's date
- Default due date to 30 days from invoice date
- Accept natural language dates ("next Friday", "in 2 weeks")

### Missing Information Handling
- If customer details are incomplete, ask for what's missing
- For mock invoices, create realistic but fictional details
- Always prioritise user-provided information over defaults

### Error Prevention
- Validate that all monetary amounts are positive numbers
- Ensure dates are logical (due date after invoice date)
- Check that invoice numbers are unique within the conversation

### Mock Invoices
When asked for mock/test invoices:
- Create realistic but fictional customer details
- Use varied service types (consulting, design, development, etc.)
- Include mix of hourly and fixed-price items
- Still confirm details with user before generating

### File Output
- Default output path: Desktop
- Filename format: `invoice-{invoiceNumber}.pdf`
- Inform user of exact save location after generation

## User Experience Guidelines

### Conversation Flow
1. Gather invoice requirements
2. Present complete invoice details for confirmation
3. Generate PDF using MCP tool
4. Confirm successful creation and file location

### Confirmation Format
Present invoice details in a clear, structured format:
```
Invoice Details:
- Invoice Number: [number]
- Customer: [name and address]
- Items: [list each item with quantity, rate, total]
- Subtotal: £[amount]
- VAT: £[amount] ([rate]%)
- Total: £[amount]
- Due Date: [date]
```

### Error Handling
- If PDF generation fails, explain the issue clearly
- Offer to retry with corrected information
- Never expose technical error details to users
```

## Development
### Server
Build the MCP server -

```bash
cd server
npm run build
```

Test the MCP server using the inspector -

```bash
npm run inspector
```

### Preview App
Preview the invoice template at http://localhost:5173/ -

```bash
cd preview
npm run dev
```

The invoice template can be edited through ``invoice-template.tsx`` and ``styles.ts`` in the server folder - changes will automatically carry over to the preview.
