# üîí Security Update: Private Buckets + Signed URLs

## What Changed?

In response to the security concern: *"if I make this bucket public, can not everybody easily steal my invoice information?"*

We've updated the system to use **PRIVATE buckets with time-limited signed URLs** instead of public buckets.

## Files Modified

### 1. **`server/src/index-smithery-robust.ts`**

**Changed: `uploadPDF()` method**
- ‚ùå **Before:** Generated public URLs (accessible to anyone)
- ‚úÖ **After:** Generates signed URLs with 7-day expiration

```typescript
// OLD (INSECURE):
const { data: publicUrlData } = this.supabase.storage
  .from(this.config.storageBucket)
  .getPublicUrl(filename);
return publicUrlData.publicUrl;

// NEW (SECURE):
const { data: signedUrlData } = await this.supabase.storage
  .from(this.config.storageBucket)
  .createSignedUrl(filename, 604800); // 7 days
return signedUrlData.signedUrl;
```

**Changed: Bucket creation**
- ‚ùå **Before:** `public: true` (anyone can access)
- ‚úÖ **After:** `public: false` (private, secure)

```typescript
// OLD (INSECURE):
await this.supabase.storage.createBucket(bucket, {
  public: true, // BAD!
  // ...
});

// NEW (SECURE):
await this.supabase.storage.createBucket(bucket, {
  public: false, // PRIVATE bucket
  // ...
});
```

### 2. **`smithery.yaml`**

**Updated documentation:**
- Added warning that bucket should be PRIVATE
- Clarified that signed URLs are used (7-day expiration)
- Updated descriptions to emphasize security

```yaml
storageBucket:
  description: "Bucket should be PRIVATE (not public) for security. Uses signed URLs with 7-day expiration."
```

### 3. **`SUPABASE_SETUP.md`**

**Updated setup instructions:**
- Changed "Make it Public: ‚úÖ" to "Make it Public: ‚ùå"
- Added security notes explaining why private is essential
- Updated example URLs to show signed URL format
- Changed storage policies for authenticated access

### 4. **`SECURITY.md`** (NEW)

**Created comprehensive security guide:**
- Explains private vs public buckets
- Details how signed URLs work
- Security comparison table
- Real-world attack scenarios
- FAQ section

## Security Improvements

| Aspect | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Bucket type | Public | **Private** |
| URL type | Public (permanent) | **Signed (7-day expiration)** |
| Access control | Anyone with URL | **Only with valid token** |
| URL guessing | Possible | **Impossible** |
| Token forgery | N/A | **Cryptographically protected** |
| Expiration | Never | **Automatic after 7 days** |

## What Users Need to Do

### During Supabase Setup:
1. Create bucket named `invoices`
2. **Keep "Public bucket" UNCHECKED** (leave it private)
3. Apply storage policies for authenticated access:

```sql
-- Allow authenticated uploads
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated Upload" ON storage.objects
FOR INSERT TO authenticated
WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'invoices');

-- Allow authenticated access (for signed URLs)
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated Access" ON storage.objects
FOR SELECT TO authenticated
USING (bucket_id = 'invoices');
```

### Deployment:
1. Rebuild the server: `npm run build`
2. Redeploy to Smithery: `smithery deploy`
3. Test invoice generation - URLs will now be signed URLs

## Migration Guide

If you already have a PUBLIC bucket:

### Option 1: Create New Private Bucket (Recommended)
1. Create new bucket `invoices-private` (private)
2. Update `storageBucket` config to `invoices-private`
3. Redeploy

### Option 2: Convert Existing Bucket
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí Storage
2. Click on `invoices` bucket ‚Üí Settings
3. Change from "Public" to "Private"
4. Apply the storage policies (SQL above)
5. Redeploy server with new code

**Note:** Existing public URLs will stop working. Regenerate signed URLs for any invoices that need access.

## Testing the Security

### Test 1: Verify Private Bucket
```bash
# Try to access without token (should fail)
curl https://yourproject.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/invoices/invoice-001.pdf
# Expected: 401 Unauthorized or 400 Bad Request
```

### Test 2: Verify Signed URL Works
```bash
# Generate invoice via MCP tool
# Copy the signed URL
curl "https://yourproject.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/sign/invoices/invoice-001.pdf?token=..."
# Expected: PDF downloads successfully
```

### Test 3: Verify Expiration (after 7 days)
```bash
# Wait 7 days, then try the same signed URL
curl "https://yourproject.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/sign/invoices/invoice-001.pdf?token=..."
# Expected: 401 Unauthorized (token expired)
```

## Performance Impact

‚úÖ **No performance degradation:**
- Signed URL generation is fast (~5-10ms)
- Same upload speed
- Same download speed
- No additional latency for end users

## Backward Compatibility

‚ö†Ô∏è **Breaking change:**
- Existing public URLs will stop working after bucket is made private
- Need to regenerate URLs for old invoices if access is still needed
- Consider this when planning deployment

## Support & Questions

If you have questions about the security changes:
1. Read `SECURITY.md` for detailed explanations
2. Check `SUPABASE_SETUP.md` for setup instructions
3. Review the code changes in `index-smithery-robust.ts`

**Bottom line: Your invoice data is now properly secured with industry-standard private storage + time-limited signed URLs!** üîí‚úÖ
